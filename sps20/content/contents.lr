## History

After the nice experience of [EuroPython 2015](https://ep2015.europython.eu/), a small group of enthusiasts came up with the idea of organizing a Python conference in Switzerland. After a few meetings and discussions, we organized a small, one-day, single-track and very-low-cost event in early 2016. We expected around 50 people, but 130 signed up. It was a great success, so we decided to continue organizing the conference.

Two more editions of the conference took place in 2017 and 2018. Have a look at our [talk recordings](/recordings/). And now the Python Summit will return to Rapperswil in 2020!

## Non-Profit

This is a non-profit conference that is funded entirely by its participants and the funds available to the Swiss Python Summit Association. We are not looking for sponsors.
