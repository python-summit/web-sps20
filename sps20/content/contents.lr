## History

After the good experience of [EuroPython 2015](https://ep2015.europython.eu/), a small group of enthusiasts came up with the idea to organize a Python conference in Switzerland. A few meetings and discussions later, we organized a small and very inexpensive event in early 2016. We expected about 50 people, but 130 signed up. It was a great success, so we decided to continue organizing the conference. Two more editions of the conference were held in 2017 and 2018, and after a short break, another one in 2022.

Having found some new members and a new board, we are happy to announce that the Swiss Python Summit will continue in 2023. We look forward to seeing you there!
