During this talk we will walk you through an example of using causal Machine Learning techniques to estimate causal, heterogeneous treatment effects with Open Source Python tooling.

Learning causal relationships - in contrast to mere correlations - is of great importance for many applications where we'd like to learn how to intervene with the real world: To whom should we administer which medical drug? To whom should we offer a marketing voucher? For which automated processed should we make a human expert intervene? In such situations we'd like to rest assured our decision don't just rely correlations - potentially tainted by common confounders. Rather, we'd like to make causal statements about the heterogeneous effects of administering a treatment.

In terms of making this happen, the field of Causal Inference has been able to incorporate progress from Machine Learning in theory. Yet, in practice, applications remain challenging: tooling is still somewhat immature and little examples to follow exist. Therefore, we would like to walk you through a case study of estimating causal, heterogeneous treatment effects with Open Source Python tooling.

Initially, the project focused on developing a robust deep learning framework, which required extensive manual labeling of images to train the model effectively. Recognizing the impracticality and time-consuming nature of manual labeling, we conceptualized an approach to expedite the labeling process using cluster algorithms and graph information.
Our method involved an automated labeling algorithm, which significantly accelerated the annotation phase. This algorithm demonstrated remarkable efficiency, automatically labeling images with high accuracy, thereby drastically reducing the manual effort involved. 
During the implementation, we discovered that our automated labeling algorithm was, in itself, the comprehensive solution for the classification task we aimed to address. This realization highlighted that our initial objective of deploying a deep learning model could be achieved through “classic” means.

In conclusion, our project unveiled that the automated labeling algorithm was not just a tool to facilitate deep learning, but an effective standalone solution in itself.
